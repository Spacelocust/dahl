# Overview
Hello fellow developer! 

Welcome to the Dahl repository! Dahl is a command line tool that helps developers create and use custom templates to generate files quickly and easily. With Dahl, you can save time and effort by using pre-defined templates to generate the files you need for your project, rather than starting from scratch every time.

This repository contains the source code for Dahl, as well as documentation and examples to help you get started. You can also share your own templates with the community by contributing to the repository.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Dahl is a valuable tool to have in your arsenal. Give it a try and see how it can streamline your workflow and save you time.

Thank you for checking out Dahl. We hope it becomes a valuable addition to your toolkit.

# Getting Started
## Installation

### Binary Release (Linux/OSX/Windows)

You can manually download a binary release from [the release page](https://github.com/Spacelocust/dahl/releases).

Automated install/update, don't forget to always verify what you're piping into bash:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spacelocust/dahl/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```
The script installs downloaded binary to `$HOME/.local/bin` directory by default, but it can be changed by setting `DIR` environment variable.

### Go

Required Go Version >= **1.16**

```sh
go install github.com/Spacelocust/dahl@latest
```

Required Go version >= **1.8**, <= **1.17**

```sh
go get github.com/Spacelocust/dahl
```
